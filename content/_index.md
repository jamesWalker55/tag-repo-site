# tagrepo

![](screenshot.jpg)

## What's this?

tagrepo is a file manager with the ability to tag files. It is designed for managing folders that contain many files, it enables you to search for files quickly and provides an easy way to tag files.

Currently, it is oriented towards audio production users with features such as audio previewing, though it's still perfectly suitable for most other purposes. I plan to expand its functionality with features like image previewing and plugin support in the future.

Implemented Features:

- File tagging
- A flexible search engine that supports searching by tags and path names
- File tracking on Windows _(other platforms are untested, but should work)_
- "Folders" panel for filtering by directory
- Audio preview _(WIP)_

Planned features:

- Image preview
- File sorting
- Better cross-platform compatibility
- ... and much more!
